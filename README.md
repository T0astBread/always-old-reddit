## Is this on AMO/the Chrome store?

No, as there are already a million extensions like this out there.

I wrote this because it's like one line of meaningful code so I
didn't wanna install someone else's extension for that. (I use an
"unbranded" Firefox build so I can just install extensions locally.)
